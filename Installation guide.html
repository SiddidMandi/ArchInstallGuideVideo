lsblk
shows disks and devices attached
</p>

<p>
Make sure boot disk is FAT32, it should also be EFI, not linux file system
</p>

<p>
-Disk Commands-
lsblk   			this lists the partitioned devices you have
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1p1 		make sure the boot one is not linux file system,
it has to be efi boot,
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1 	do this to boot partition
</p>

<p>
mkdir /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt 	the main one, NOT the boot one
mkdir /mnt/boot
mkdir /mnt/boot/EFI
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/EFI 	the small boot one to here
</p>

<p>
now a quick lil hint here, if you can't edit the partition as it is 'read only'
use this command 
</p>

<p>
mount t-o remount,rw /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi 
or whichever partitoin you are having problems with 
</p>

<p>
once partitions are formatted and mounted, its time to actually install it all
but we do some things before
</p>

<p>
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
this should do the trick but incase here are some extra commands
</p>

<p>
pacman-key --populate archlinux
pacman-key --refresh-keys
pacman -Syu
this will prevent errors like "failed to install package...is marginal trust"
</p>

<p>
pacstrap &lt;destination&gt; &lt;packages&gt;
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-firmware vim
yk what vim is, I won't get into that shit here. Vim only
</p>

<p>
Gen the fstab, this contains the drives linux will look for on boot
gen fstab -U
gen fstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
the -U option chooses to use the UUID instead of name, which is far more unique
and never changes
</p>

<p>
ok you installed arch, now lets chroot right in and make some pre boot
configurations. Dont skip this step cuz we still need to install grub ok.
</p>

<div id="chroot right in"><h1 id="chroot right in" class="header"><a href="#chroot right in">chroot right in</a></h1></div>
<p>
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
ok now you are in the new system and time to make some pre install configs
go ahead and type ls, this will show you familiar directories
</p>

<p>
pacman -S networkmanager grub neofetch
</p>

<p>
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
</p>

<p>
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1p1 	the smaller boot partition
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</p>

<p>
make sure it says "found linux image" and all, if not you probably skipped the
most important step, which is pacstrap installing it all.
</p>

<p>
now here just do this:
cd root
touch .vimrc
vim .vimrc 
and add these lines
</p>
<pre>
syntax on
set number
inoremap kj &lt;Esc&gt;
set mouse=a
</pre>
<p>
this will make text editing waaay easier and reduce chances of syntax errors
which might cause depression
</p>

<p>
vim /etc/default/grub
uncomment "GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false"
pattern search for it using /, see this is also an excellent vim tutorial
</p>

<p>
passwd
set a password
</p>

<p>
vim /etc/locate.gen
here select the language, on vim pattern search for en_US 
and uncomment out the 2 lines. The #s are comments
</p>

<p>
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US ISO-8859-1
is what the lines should look like
:wq that shit
</p>

<p>
now run 
locale-gen
</p>

<p>
vim /etc/locale.conf
type
LANG=en-US.UTF-8
:wq that shit 
</p>

<p>
vim /etc/hostname 
set host name here
</p>

<p>
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Singapore /etc/localtime
this system link basically connects the correct timezone to your time file
also create another useful system link, some thins like cronie and all still use
vi, so just make a system link for vim to vi 
</p>

<p>
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vi
this basically means everytime something tries to use vi, it will use vim
</p>

<p>
ok now reboot and login
</p>

<p>
and now the moment you have all been waiting for:
neofetch
</p>

<p>
just don't become a salty misagynistic reddit mod who is fat af, never touches
grass, wears a fedora, can't do pullups and never touches grass.
</p>

<p>
Booting arch doesn't have to mean you are an obnoxious cunt... Honestly there
isn't much to 'booting arch', this is actually a meme invented my retarded
apple users who fear competency with technology.
</p>

<p>
I might make more videos on how to patch dwm and all, but I believe there are
better videos on it out there, 
</p>

<p>
and there is chatGPT... Boi that thing can literally write all your shell
scripts for you...
